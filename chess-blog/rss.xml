            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#x27;m proud of the fact that I played a really solid game. I kept waiting and waiting, and then my opponent moved a bishop protecting the queen and promptly blundered the queen. After taking his queen, he resigned!</p><p><img src="/img/chess/2022-03-31-solid-game/board.gif" alt="solid game"/></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is a great game I played recently at around 500! I&#x27;m white, opponent is black.</p><p>I am proud of the move 26 Bishop E5. This moved allowed me to check the Black King, and collect a rook. This move had a discovered check, which then allowed me to take the other rook without losing my bishop. After collecting both rooks and threatening the knight on b4, my opponent resigned.</p><p><img src="/img/chess/2022-03-25-vs-measmyself/board.gif" alt="game vs measmyself"/></p>]]></content:encoded>
