I really liked how my light-squared bishop covered everything for a while, allowing me to move my knight into attack and open up my queen for the final checkmate. I finished the game with about 1 minute on the clock.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This was a tough game. I got murdered by my opponent. This is called the <a href="https://chesspathways.com/chess-openings/kings-pawn-opening/wayward-queen-attack/">Wayward Queen Attack</a>, and to defend it I had to play Nc6 then g6. This forces the queen back, and then if the queen goes back to e3, I play Nf6.</p><p><img src="/img/chess/2022-03-31-i-got-murdered.gif" alt="solid game"/></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I&#x27;m proud of the fact that I played a really solid game. I kept waiting and waiting, and then my opponent moved a bishop protecting the queen and promptly blundered the queen. After taking his queen, he resigned!</p><p><img src="/img/chess/2022-03-31-solid-game.gif" alt="solid game"/></p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Here is a great game I played recently at around 500! I&#x27;m white, opponent is black.</p><p>I am proud of the move 26 Bishop E5. This moved allowed me to check the Black King, and collect a rook. This move had a discovered check, which then allowed me to take the other rook without losing my bishop. After collecting both rooks and threatening the knight on b4, my opponent resigned.</p><p><img src="/img/chess/2022-03-25-vs-measmyself.gif" alt="game vs measmyself"/></p>]]></content:encoded>
