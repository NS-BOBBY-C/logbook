This is called the <a href="https://chesspathways.com/chess-openings/kings-pawn-opening/wayward-queen-attack/">Wayward Queen Attack</a>, and to defend it I had to play Nc6 then g6. This forces the queen back, and then if the queen goes back to e3, I play Nf6.</p><p><img src="/img/chess/2022-03-31-i-got-murdered/board.gif" alt="solid game"/></p>]]></content>
