# Game

Here is a great game I played recently at around 500! I'm white, opponent is black.

I am proud of the move 26 Bishop E5. This moved allowed me to check the Black King, and collect a rook. This move had a discovered check, which then allowed me to take the other rook without losing my bishop. After collecting both rooks and threatening the knight on b4, my opponent resigned.
