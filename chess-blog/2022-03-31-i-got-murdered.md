# Game

This was a tough game. I got murdered by my opponent. This is called the [Wayward Queen Attack](https://chesspathways.com/chess-openings/kings-pawn-opening/wayward-queen-attack/), and to defend it I had to play Nc6 then g6. This forces the queen back, and then if the queen goes back to e3, I play Nf6.
