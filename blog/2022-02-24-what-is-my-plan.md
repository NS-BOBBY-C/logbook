# What is my plan?

Often times you get asked about "What is your 5 year plan?" and I have NO idea about specifics.

As of right now, I know:

## 1. I want to start my own business

I know I can run a successful business. I am very detail oriented and I have a lot of experience "running" a team to create a product. I have made mistakes and have been overextended, but with one sole product and enough time, I know that I can create a product that will be successful.

## 2. I might need to go back to school to get an MBA

I don't know everything I need to know to start a good business. I can create a decent software product, but I don't know how to create a successful business from a software product.

## 3. I don't have a good idea for a business that I want to commit to

One of the ideas I've had before is a "social wellness" platform. It would be very similar to [NextStep GoodLife](nextstepgoodlife.com), but I don't really want to make another social media app. I've thought about making a fitness tracking app, but that is a super saturated market and I don't want to be in it. I thought about "party tech" but there isn't a huge market for scalability - just frat bros and sorority girls in that market. That would include party planning apps, which is somewhat niche. I've also thought about creating a javascript teaching platform, something in crypto, or something else entirely.

Eesha had an idea to see everything about her health records in one place by connecting portals together. I don't know how to monetize this.

TLDR; Ideas list:

- Create a social wellness platform
- Create a fitness tracking app
- Create a party planning app
- Create a teaching platform
- Create a something in crypto
- Create a health records app
