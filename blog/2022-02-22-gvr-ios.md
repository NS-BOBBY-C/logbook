# Adding back GVR on iOS for Viro

VR was removed on iOS in the last few months, but it's still a huge part of the ecosystem. This is supported on Android, and we're working on adding it back to iOS. This entry records my progress and troubleshooting.

## PR

The pull request is [here](https://github.com/ViroCommunity/viro/pull/73). I had to filter .pngs, .strings, and .bin files out of the PR so I could even load the page. This PR is a bit of a mess and I think there is work which has already been done which is duplicated here. `static_lib/` has already been removed.

## Looking around

There is some commented out code

## Discussion with Ed

### Todo

1. Rebuild virocore

[https://github.com/ViroCommunity/virocore#ios-building-the-renderer-to-be-used-in-react-viro-platform](building virocore to be used in react-viro).

- [ ] Having trouble doing this. It seems that ios/dist does not get completely regenerated when ViroKit is rebuilt. I'm not sure why!


2. uncomment references

- [x] should be done!

3. Distribute virocore with cocoa pods

This is the part to figure out.
