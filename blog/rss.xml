            <description><![CDATA[Introduction]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a class="hash-link" href="#introduction" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Over the course of the past few months, I have been working on a side project called <a href="https://www.athelites.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AthElites.io</a>. I wanted to build a platform that would allow me to be more honest with myself and help me keep track of my workouts better. I built the application using <a href="https://expo.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expo</a> and I was very proud of the application. AthElites was published to the app store on June 26th, 2022.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-idea">The Idea<a class="hash-link" href="#the-idea" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>AthElites differentiated itself from other mobile fitness trackers by using customizable audio cues to help a lifter breathe, brace, and perform movements. The goal was never to teach a new lifter how to perform a movement, but rather help intermediate and advanced lifters take their workouts to the next level.</p><p>I will say, this was the part I was most pleased with of the project. Using the Expo Speech Synthesis API, I was able to get a prototype that was relatively customizable. This idea may be released as a standalone application because I do really like how this operates and has lots of potential. I realized in my own training that I find it hard to accurately count the number of repetitions in real time, and this eased the cognitive load while working out. This is something I will likely strip down and either release as a re-branded application (likely called "Cues" or something to that effect), but I have no desire to work on the project right now.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-numbers">The Numbers<a class="hash-link" href="#the-numbers" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Here are some <em>super big</em> numbers for my first real project!</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="money">Money<a class="hash-link" href="#money" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><table><thead><tr><th></th><th></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Total Revenue</td><td>$0.00</td></tr><tr><td>Total Spent</td><td>$49.99</td></tr><tr><td>Net</td><td>($49.99)</td></tr></tbody></table><p>The only thing I spent money on was the AthElites.io domain.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="users">Users<a class="hash-link" href="#users" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>At the time of stopping the application, App Store Connect looked like:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th align="right">Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>App Store Page Impressions</td><td align="right">1,500</td></tr><tr><td>App Units</td><td align="right">26</td></tr><tr><td>Proceeds</td><td align="right">$0</td></tr><tr><td>Sessions</td><td align="right">40</td></tr><tr><td>Crashes</td><td align="right">0</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="social-media">Social Media<a class="hash-link" href="#social-media" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>I found out the hard way that creating content is time consuming and I find it boring. I think trying to make videos and have a content calendar was a large part of the reason I stopped trying to build this application, since I really hated putting in the effort to slowly grow organic content. My approach was off and I wasn't focusing on actually driving app downloads by trying to sell the application; I thought the application would sell itself through the half-assed content I was creating. I liked twitter the most because it was the easiest to actually create - most of the tweets were easy and I quickly learned that joining the conversation on twitter was the best way to get likes and impressions, especially on trending topics.</p><table><thead><tr><th>TikTok</th><th align="right">Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Posts</td><td align="right">8</td></tr><tr><td>Views</td><td align="right">1,806</td></tr><tr><td>Profile views</td><td align="right">52</td></tr><tr><td>Likes</td><td align="right">18</td></tr><tr><td>Comments</td><td align="right">6</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>Twitter</th><th align="right">Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tweets</td><td align="right">92</td></tr><tr><td>Impressions</td><td align="right">3,345</td></tr><tr><td>Followers</td><td align="right">20</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>YouTube</th><th align="right">Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Posts</td><td align="right">9</td></tr><tr><td>Subscribers</td><td align="right">5</td></tr><tr><td>Views</td><td align="right">1,848</td></tr><tr><td>Watch time</td><td align="right">4.7 hours</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th>Instagram</th><th align="right">Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Posts</td><td align="right">11</td></tr><tr><td>Followers</td><td align="right">10</td></tr><tr><td>Unique accounts reached</td><td align="right">322</td></tr><tr><td>Profile visits</td><td align="right">61</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-stop">Why stop?<a class="hash-link" href="#why-stop" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I've decided to stop working on this application for a few reasons. The main reason is I have decided to shift my goals and I need to cut back on the project I'm trying to do at once. I didn't burn out, but I really am not enjoying this project any more. I had lots of great ideas in the beginning and I think there is still a place for a mobile application to disrupt the current state of the mobile fitness tracking market.</p><p>The main reason I am cutting the experiment is that I watched a video discussing how to build a business without taking on debt. The video focused on a “sales first” entrepreneurial mindset. I realized that this project was not following a “sales first” flow because I was focusing too much on what the product actually was, and not trying to sell the project.</p><p>Social media is hard. Trying to build social media as a primary means of selling to people via TikTok and instagram without actually knowing what you're doing is hard. I was making videos as quickly as possible, an</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="am-i-giving-up">Am I Giving Up?<a class="hash-link" href="#am-i-giving-up" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Hell no I'm not! I'm working on another project with a friend and I'm going to take some time for myself to be creative and try and think of new ideas. I like to solve problems, and when I think there is a problem that can be solved with technology or building a website, I am ALL game.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="but-youre-down-50">But You're down $50<a class="hash-link" href="#but-youre-down-50" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>Yes, I am down $50. I'm very fortunate that this was not a lot of money to me and spending this money to further along my learning was well worth it. I learned so much about what goes into building a product and more importantly, building a product that people will actually buy. This whole experience has me thinking about shifting my focus to figuring out something I'm passionate about and enjoy enough to try and make a business.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Often times you get asked about "What is your 5 year plan?" and I have NO idea about specifics.</p><p>As of right now, I know:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-i-want-to-start-my-own-business">1. I want to start my own business<a class="hash-link" href="#1-i-want-to-start-my-own-business" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><p>I know I can run a successful business. I am very detail oriented and I have a lot of experience "running" a team to create a product. I have made mistakes and have been overextended, but with one sole product and enough time, I know that I can create a product that will be successful.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2-i-might-need-to-go-back-to-school-to-get-an-mba">2.

I can create a decent software product, but I don't know how to create a successful business from a software product.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-i-dont-have-a-good-idea-for-a-business-that-i-want-to-commit-to">3.

It would be very similar to <a href="https://nextstepgoodlife.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NextStep GoodLife</a>, but I don't really want to make another social media app. I've thought about making a fitness tracking app, but that is a super saturated market and I don't want to be in it. I thought about "party tech" but there isn't a huge market for scalability - just frat bros and sorority girls in that market. That would include party planning apps, which is somewhat niche. I've also thought about creating a javascript teaching platform, something in crypto, or something else entirely.</p><p>Eesha had an idea to see everything about her health records in one place by connecting portals together. I don't know how to monetize this.</p><p>TLDR; Ideas list:</p><ul><li>Create a social wellness platform</li><li>Create a fitness tracking app</li><li>Create a party planning app</li><li>Create a teaching platform</li><li>Create a something in crypto</li><li>Create a health records app</li></ul>]]></content:encoded>
