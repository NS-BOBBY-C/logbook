# What is this?

I was inspired by a post on Reddit which linked to an [article](https://conorcorp.github.io/posts/make-debuggin-suck-less/) that I thought was a really good idea. This repo is a simple way to keep track of issues I have while developing, and links/resolutions I find useful. 

This repo is a Docusaurus project and I'll be posting the resolutions to issues as I fix them. The main structure of this repo is to keep the programming language or main framework organized. I intend on creating a folder for each language or framework, and then a file for each issue I have.
