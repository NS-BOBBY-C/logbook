# What is this?

I was inspired by a post on Reddit which linked to an [article](https://conorcorp.github.io/posts/make-debuggin-suck-less/) that I thought was a really good idea. This repo is a simple way to keep track of issues I have while developing, and links/resolutions I find useful.

This repo is a work in progress, and I'm open to any feedback! Reach out to me on twitter [@bob_colley](https://twitter.com/bob_colley) or email me at [robertcolley04@gmail.com](mailto:robertcolley04@gmail.com).
