I don\'t have a good idea for a business that I want to commit to\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the ideas I\'ve had before is a \\"social wellness\\" platform. It would be very similar to [NextStep GoodLife](https://nextstepgoodlife.com), but I don\'t really want to make another social media app. I\'ve thought about making a fitness tracking app, but that is a super saturated market and I don\'t want to be in it. I thought about \\"party tech\\" but there isn\'t a huge market for scalability - just frat bros and sorority girls in that market. That would include party planning apps, which is somewhat niche. I\'ve also thought about creating a javascript teaching platform, something in crypto, or something else entirely.\\r\\n\\r\\nEesha had an idea to see everything about her health records in one place by connecting portals together.
