I want to start my own business\\n\\nI know I can run a successful business. I am very detail oriented and I have a lot of experience \\"running\\" a team to create a product. I have made mistakes and have been overextended, but with one sole product and enough time, I know that I can create a product that will be successful.\\n\\n## 2. I might need to go back to school to get an MBA\\n\\nI don\'t know everything I need to know to start a good business. I can create a decent software product, but I don\'t know how to create a successful business from a software product.\\n\\n## 3. I don\'t have a good idea for a business that I want to commit to\\n\\nOne of the ideas I\'ve had before is a \\"social wellness\\" platform. It would be very similar to [NextStep GoodLife](https://nextstepgoodlife.com), but I don\'t really want to make another social media app. I\'ve thought about making a fitness tracking app, but that is a super saturated market and I don\'t want to be in it. I thought about \\"party tech\\" but there isn\'t a huge market for scalability - just frat bros and sorority girls in that market. That would include party planning apps, which is somewhat niche. I\'ve also thought about creating a javascript teaching platform, something in crypto, or something else entirely.\\n\\nEesha had an idea to see everything about her health records in one place by connecting portals together. I don\'t know how to monetize this.\\n\\nTLDR; Ideas list:\\n\\n- Create a social wellness platform\\n- Create a fitness tracking app\\n- Create a party planning app\\n- Create a teaching platform\\n- Create a something in crypto\\n- Create a health records app"}]}')}}]);
