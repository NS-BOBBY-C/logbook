I wanted to build a platform that would allow me to be more honest with myself and help me keep track of my workouts better. I built the application using [expo](https://expo.dev) and I was very proud of the application. AthElites was published to the app store on June 26th, 2022.\\n\\n## The Idea\\n\\nAthElites differentiated itself from other mobile fitness trackers by using customizable audio cues to help a lifter breathe, brace, and perform movements. The goal was never to teach a new lifter how to perform a movement, but rather help intermediate and advanced lifters take their workouts to the next level.\\n\\nI will say, this was the part I was most pleased with of the project. Using the Expo Speech Synthesis API, I was able to get a prototype that was relatively customizable. This idea may be released as a standalone application because I do really like how this operates and has lots of potential. I realized in my own training that I find it hard to accurately count the number of repetitions in real time, and this eased the cognitive load while working out. This is something I will likely strip down and either release as a re-branded application (likely called \\"Cues\\" or something to that effect), but I have no desire to work on the project right now.\\n\\n## The Numbers\\n\\nHere are some *super big* numbers for my first real project!\\n\\n### Money\\n\\n|               |          |\\n| ------------- | -------- |\\n| Total Revenue | $0.00    |\\n| Total Spent   | $49.99   |\\n| Net           | ($49.99) |\\n\\nThe only thing I spent money on was the AthElites.io domain.\\n\\n### Users\\n\\nAt the time of stopping the application, App Store Connect looked like:\\n\\n| Metric                     | Value |\\n| -------------------------- | ----: |\\n| App Store Page Impressions | 1,500 |\\n| App Units                  |    26 |\\n| Proceeds                   |    $0 |\\n| Sessions                   |    40 |\\n| Crashes                    |     0 |\\n\\n### Social Media\\n\\nI found out the hard way that creating content is time consuming and I find it boring. I think trying to make videos and have a content calendar was a large part of the reason I stopped trying to build this application, since I really hated putting in the effort to slowly grow organic content. My approach was off and I wasn\'t focusing on actually driving app downloads by trying to sell the application; I thought the application would sell itself through the half-assed content I was creating. I liked twitter the most because it was the easiest to actually create - most of the tweets were easy and I quickly learned that joining the conversation on twitter was the best way to get likes and impressions, especially on trending topics.\\n\\n| TikTok        | Value |\\n| ------------- | ----: |\\n| Posts         |     8 |\\n| Views         | 1,806 |\\n| Profile views |    52 |\\n| Likes         |    18 |\\n| Comments      |     6 |\\n\\n| Twitter     | Value |\\n| ----------- | ----: |\\n| Tweets      |    92 |\\n| Impressions | 3,345 |\\n| Followers   |    20 |\\n\\n| YouTube     |     Value |\\n| ----------- | --------: |\\n| Posts       |         9 |\\n| Subscribers |         5 |\\n| Views       |     1,848 |\\n| Watch time  | 4.7 hours |\\n\\n| Instagram               | Value |\\n| ----------------------- | ----: |\\n| Posts                   |    11 |\\n| Followers               |    10 |\\n| Unique accounts reached |   322 |\\n| Profile visits          |    61 |\\n\\n## Why stop?\\n\\nI\'ve decided to stop working on this application for a few reasons. The main reason is I have decided to shift my goals and I need to cut back on the project I\'m trying to do at once. I didn\'t burn out, but I really am not enjoying this project any more. I had lots of great ideas in the beginning and I think there is still a place for a mobile application to disrupt the current state of the mobile fitness tracking market.\\n\\nThe main reason I am cutting the experiment is that I watched a video discussing how to build a business without taking on debt. The video focused on a \u201csales first\u201d entrepreneurial mindset. I realized that this project was not following a \u201csales first\u201d flow because I was focusing too much on what the product actually was, and not trying to sell the project.\\n\\nSocial media is hard. Trying to build social media as a primary means of selling to people via TikTok and instagram without actually knowing what you\'re doing is hard. I was making videos as quickly as possible, an\\n\\n## Am I Giving Up?\\n\\nHell no I\'m not! I\'m working on another project with a friend and I\'m going to take some time for myself to be creative and try and think of new ideas. I like to solve problems, and when I think there is a problem that can be solved with technology or building a website, I am ALL game.\\n\\n## But You\'re down $50\\n\\nYes, I am down $50. I\'m very fortunate that this was not a lot of money to me and spending this money to further along my learning was well worth it. I learned so much about what goes into building a product and more importantly, building a product that people will actually buy. This whole experience has me thinking about shifting my focus to figuring out something I\'m passionate about and enjoy enough to try and make a business."},{"id":"/2022/06/11/about-me","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/2022/06/11/about-me","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-11-about-me.md","title":"About Me","description":"Hi!

I thought about \\"party tech\\" but there isn\'t a huge market for scalability - just frat bros and sorority girls in that market. That would include party planning apps, which is somewhat niche.
